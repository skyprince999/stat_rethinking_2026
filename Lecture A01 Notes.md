- Prior model checking: to check if the model is correct before its modeled , scientific sense
- Posterior model checking: to check after the model has been created . After the data has been "fitted"
- Parameter estimation:
  
           - marginal effects (statistical averaging)
           - casual error estimation
           - sensitivity analysis

- Bayesian vs Frequentism :: Bayseian has prevailed
